# TurningMachine
Command Line Turing Machine in Python
Created a Turning machine simulator that runs on command line.

The states, alphabet, input etc are all customizable. There are no assumptions made (except Left, Right and No Move symbols)

Very descriptive and detailed. Works better than most of the projects I found out there.

#How To use
python3 Turing.py <path_turing_machine_file>

The sample files are descriptive enough to use. The code is well documented to change.
